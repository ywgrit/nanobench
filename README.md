## 移植重心！

考虑是否直接写一个循环执行代码即可

重点在弄清汇编是怎么执行的（通过debug mode或者修改nanobench.sh），不一定非得通过csr指令获取性能数据



# nanoBench

*nanoBench* is a Linux-based tool for running small microbenchmarks on recent Intel and AMD x86 CPUs. The microbenchmarks are evaluated using [hardware performance counters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_performance_counter). The reading of the performance counters is implemented in a way that incurs only minimal overhead.

There are two variants of the tool: A user-space implementation and a kernel module. The kernel module makes it possible to benchmark privileged instructions, to use uncore performance counters, and it can allow for more accurate measurement results as it disables interrupts and preemptions during measurements. The disadvantage of the kernel module compared to the user-space variant is that it is quite risky to allow arbitrary code to be executed in kernel space. Therefore, the kernel module should not be used on a production system.

**一般不要用kernel，使用user**

*nanoBench* is used for running the microbenchmarks for obtaining the latency, throughput, and port usage data that is available on [uops.info](http:www.uops.info).

More information about *nanoBench* can be found in the paper [nanoBench: A Low-Overhead Tool for Running Microbenchmarks on x86 Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03282).

## Installation

### User-space Version

    sudo apt install msr-tools
    git clone https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench.git
    cd nanoBench
    make user

*nanoBench might not work if Secure Boot is enabled. [Click here](https://askubuntu.com/a/762255/925982) for instructions on how to disable Secure Boot.*

### Kernel Module
*Note: The following is not necessary if you would just like to use the user-space version.*

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install plotly
    git clone https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench.git
    cd nanoBench
    make kernel

To load the kernel module, run:

    sudo insmod kernel/nb.ko # this is necessary after every reboot

## Usage Examples

**The recommended way for using *nanoBench* is with the wrapper scripts `nanoBench.sh` (for the user-space variant) and `kernel-nanoBench.sh` (for the kernel module).** The following examples work with both of these scripts. For the kernel module, we also provide a Python wrapper: `kernelNanoBench.py`.

For obtaining repeatable results, it can help to disable hyper-threading. This can be done with the `disable-HT.sh` script.

## 工作原理

将汇编代码展开多次（unroll_count），并多次测量代码（n_measurements），取性能计数器的平均值

在测量之前，会有几次（warm_up_count）的预热，所以程序总共运行warm_up_count+n_measurements次

可以使用`-asm_init`选项使代码只在最开始运行一次，例如使用`-asm_init`选项初始化寄存器

代码会复制unroll_count份，对于复制的代码，可以循环执行loop_count次。

具体的原理在**Generated Code**这一节

util.sh文件会将汇编编译为二进制，再将二进制的文本段插入到一个临时二进制文件中。

执行流程

```C++
int run(code, code_init, local_unroll_count):
    int measurements[n_measurements]

    for i=-warm_up_count to n_measurements
        save_regs
        code_init
        loop 
        m1 = read_perf_ctrs // stores results in memory, does not modify registers
        code_late_init
        for j=0 to loop_count // this line is omitted if loop_count=0
            code // (copy #1)
            code // (copy #2)
             ⋮
            code // (copy #local_unroll_count)
        m2 = read_perf_ctrs
        restore_regs
        if i >= 0: // ignore warm-up runs
            measurements[i] = m2 - m1

    return agg(measurements) // apply selected aggregate function
```

### Example 1: The ADD Instruction

The following command will benchmark the assembler code sequence "ADD RAX, RBX; ADD RBX, RAX" on a Skylake-based system.

    sudo ./nanoBench.sh -asm "ADD RAX, RBX; ADD RBX, RAX" -config configs/cfg_Skylake_common.txt

It will produce an output similar to the following.

    CORE_CYCLES: 2.00
    INST_RETIRED: 2.00
    UOPS_ISSUED: 2.00
    UOPS_EXECUTED: 2.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_0: 0.49
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_1: 0.50
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_2: 0.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_3: 0.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_4: 0.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_5: 0.50
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_6: 0.51
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_7: 0.00
    ...

The tool will *unroll* the assembler code multiple times, i.e., it will create multiple copies of it. The results are averages per copy of the assembler code for multiple runs of the entire generated code sequence.

The config file contains the required information for configuring the programmable performance counters with the desired events. We provide example configuration files for recent Intel and AMD microarchitectures in the `config` folder.

The assembler code sequence may use and modify any general-purpose or vector registers (unless the `-loop` or `-no_mem` options are used), including the stack pointer. There is no need to restore the registers to their original values at the end.

R14, RDI, RSI, RSP, and RBP are initialized with addresses in the middle of dedicated memory areas (of 1 MB each), that can be freely modified by the assembler code. When using the kernel module, the size of the memory area that R14 points to can be increased using the `set-R14-size.sh` script; more details on this can be found [here](tools/CacheAnalyzer#prerequisites).

All other registers have initially undefined values. They can, however, be initialized as shown in the following example.

### Example 2: Load Latency

    sudo ./nanoBench.sh -asm_init "MOV RAX, R14; SUB RAX, 8; MOV [RAX], RAX" -asm "MOV RAX, [RAX]" -config configs/cfg_Skylake_common.txt

The `asm-init` code is executed once in the beginning. It first sets RAX to R14-8 (thus, RAX now contains a valid memory address), and then sets the memory at address RAX to its own address. Then, the `asm` code is executed repeatedly. This code loads the value at the address in RAX into RAX. Thus, the execution time of this instruction corresponds to the L1 data cache latency.

We will get an output similar to the following.

    CORE_CYCLES: 4.00
    INST_RETIRED: 1.00
    UOPS_ISSUED.ANY: 1.00
    UOPS_EXECUTED.THREAD: 1.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_0: 0.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_1: 0.00
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_2: 0.50
    UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT.PORT_3: 0.50
    ...
    MEM_LOAD_RETIRED.L1_HIT: 1.00
    MEM_LOAD_RETIRED.L1_MISS: 0.00
    ...

## Generated Code

We will now take a look behind the scenes at the code that *nanoBench* generates for evaluating a microbenchmark.

    int run(code, code_init, local_unroll_count):
        int measurements[n_measurements]
    
        for i=-warm_up_count to n_measurements
            save_regs
            code_init
            m1 = read_perf_ctrs // stores results in memory, does not modify registers
            code_late_init
            for j=0 to loop_count // this line is omitted if loop_count=0
                code // (copy #1)
                code // (copy #2)
                 ⋮
                code // (copy #local_unroll_count)
            m2 = read_perf_ctrs
            restore_regs
            if i >= 0: // ignore warm-up runs
                measurements[i] = m2 - m1
    
        return agg(measurements) // apply selected aggregate function

`run(...)` is executed twice: The first time with `local_unroll_count = unroll_count`, and the second time with `local_unroll_count = 2 * unroll_count`. If the `-basic_mode` options is used, the first execution is with no instructions between `m1 = read_perf_ctrs` and `m2 = read_perf_ctrs`, and the second with `local_unroll_count = unroll_count`.


The result that is finally reported by *nanoBench* is the difference between these two executions divided by `max(loop_count * unroll_count, unroll_count)`.

Before the first execution of `run(...)`, the performance counters are configured according to the event specifications in the `-config` file. If this file contains more events than there are programmable performance counters available, `run(...)` is executed multiple times with different performance counter configurations.

## Command-line Options

Both `nanoBench.sh` and `kernel-nanoBench.sh` support the following command-line parameters. All parameters are optional. Parameter names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique (e.g., `-l` may be used instead of `-loop_count`).

| Option                       | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `-asm <code>`                | Assembler code sequence (in Intel syntax<sup>[1](#syntax)</sup>) containing the code to be benchmarked. |
| `-asm_init <code>`           | Assembler code sequence (in Intel syntax<sup>[1](#syntax)</sup>) that is executed once in the beginning of every benchmark run. |
| `-asm_late_init <code>`      | Assembler code sequence (in Intel syntax<sup>[1](#syntax)</sup>) that is executed once immediately before the code to be benchmarked. |
| `-asm_one_time_init <code>`  | Assembler code sequence (in Intel syntax<sup>[1](#syntax)</sup>) that is executed once before the first benchmark run. |
| `-code <filename>`           | A binary file containing the code to be benchmarked as raw x86 machine code.  *This option cannot be used together with `-asm`.* |
| `-code_init <filename>`      | A binary file containing code to be executed once in the beginning of every benchmark run. *This option cannot be used together with `-asm_init`.* |
| `-code_late_init <filename>` | A binary file containing code to be executed once immediately before the code to be benchmarked. *This option cannot be used together with `-asm_late_init`.* |
| `-code_one_time_init <code>` | A binary file containing code to be executed once before the first benchmark run. *This option cannot be used together with `-asm_one_time_init`.*|
| `-config <file>`             | File with performance counter event specifications. Details are described [below](#performance-counter-config-files). |
| `-fixed_counters`            | Reads the fixed-function performance counters. |
| `-n_measurements <n>`        | Number of times the measurements are repeated. `[Default: n=10]` |
| `-unroll_count <n>`          | Number of copies of the benchmark code inside the inner loop. `[Default: n=1000]` |
| `-loop_count <n>`            | Number of iterations of the inner loop. If n>0, the code to be benchmarked **must not modify R15**, as this register contains the loop counter. If n=0, the instructions for the loop are omitted; the loop body is then executed once. `[Default: n=0]` |
| `-warm_up_count <n>`         | Number of runs of the generated benchmark code sequence (in each invocation of `run(...)`) before the first measurement result gets recorded . This can, for example, be useful for excluding outliers due to cold caches.   `[Default: n=5]` |
| `-initial_warm_up_count <n>` | Number of runs of the benchmark code sequence before the first invocation of `run(...)`. This can be useful for benchmarking instructions that require a warm-up period before they can execute at full speed, like [AVX2 instructions on some microarchitectures](https://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=415).  `[Default: n=0]` |
| `-alignment_offset <n>`      | By default, the code to be benchmarked is aligned to 64 bytes. This parameter allows to specify an additional offset. `[Default: n=0]` |
| `-avg`                       | Selects the arithmetic mean (excluding the top and bottom 20% of the values) as the aggregate function. `[This is the default]` |
| `-median`                    | Selects the median as the aggregate function. |
| `-min`                       | Selects the minimum as the aggregate function. |
| `-max`                       | Selects the maximum as the aggregate function. |
| `-basic_mode`                | The effect of this option is described in the [Generated Code](#generated-code) section. |
| `-no_mem`                    | If this option is enabled, the code for `read_perf_ctrs` does not make any memory accesses and stores all performance counter values in registers. This can, for example, be useful for benchmarks that require that the state of the data caches does not change after the execution of `code_init`. *If this option is used, the code to be benchmarked must not modify registers* ***R8-R11 (Intel)*** *and* ***R8-R13 (AMD).*** *Furthermore, `read_perf_ctrs` will modify* ***RAX, RCX, and RDX***. |
| `-no_normalization`          | If this option is enabled, the measurement results are not divided by the number of repetitions. |
| `-remove_empty_events`       | If this option is enabled, the output does not contain events that did not occur. |
| `-df`                        | If this option is enabled, the front-end buffers are drained after `code_init`, after `code_late_init`, and after the last instance of `code` by executing an lfence, followed by a long sequence of 1-Byte `NOP` instructions, followed by a long sequence of 15-Byte `NOP` instructions. |
| `-cpu <n>`                   | Pins the measurement thread to CPU n. `[Default: Pin the thread to the CPU it is currently running on.]` |
| `-verbose`                   | Outputs the results of all performance counter readings. In the user-space version, the results are printed to stdout. The output of the kernel module can be accessed using `dmesg`. |

<sup id="syntax">1</sup> As an extension, the tool also supports statements of the form `|n` (with 1&le;n&le;15) that are translated to n-byte NOPs.

The following parameters are only supported by `nanoBench.sh`.

| Option     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `-usr <n>` | If n=1, performance events are counted when the processor is operating at a privilege level greater than 0. `[Default: n=1]` |
| `-os <n>`  | If n=1, performance events are counted when the processor is operating at privilege level 0.  `[Default: n=0]` |
| `-debug`   | Enables the debug mode (see [below](#debug-mode)). |

The following parameter is only supported by `kernel-nanoBench.sh`.

| Option               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `-msr_config <file>` | File with performance counter event specifications for counters that can only be read with the `RDMSR` instruction, such as uncore counters. Details are described [below](#msr-performance-counter-config-files). |

## Cycle-by-Cycle Measurements

The `cycleByCycle.py` script provides the option to perform cycle-by-cycle measurements on recent Intel CPUs. This is achieved by enabling the `Freeze_Perfmon_On_PMI` feature, by setting the value of the core cycles counter to *N* cycles below overflow, and by repeating the measurements multiple times with different values for *N*. This approach is based on [Brandon Falk's Sushi Roll technique](https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html).

As an example, the script can be used as follows.

    sudo ./cycleByCycle.py -asm "MOVQ XMM0, RAX; MOVQ RAX, XMM0" -config configs/cfg_Skylake_common.txt -unroll 10

`cycleByCycle.py` supports mostly the same options as `kernel-nanoBench.sh`, with the following exceptions. The `-fixed_counters` and `-msr_config` options are not available. The `-basic_mode`, `-df`, and `-no_normalization` options are used by default. The default for the `-unroll_count` parameter is `1`, and the default aggregate function is the median.

`cycleByCycle.py` supports the following additional parameters.

| Option             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `-html <filename>` | Generates an HTML file with a graphical representation of the measurement data. The filename is optional. `[Default: graph.html]` |
| `-csv <filename>`  | Generates a CSV file that contains the measurement data. The filename is optional. `[Default: stdout]` |
| `-end_to_end`      | By default, `cycleByCycle.py` tries to remove the overhead that comes from the instructions that enable/disable the performance counters, and from the instructions that drain the front end before/after the code of the benchmark is executed. However, this does not always work properly. In such cases, the `-end_to_end` option can be used; with this option, the output includes all of the overhead. |

## Performance Counter Config Files

We provide provide performance counter configuration files (for counters that can be read with the `RDPMC` instruction) for most recent Intel and AMD CPUs in the `configs` folder. These files can be adapted/reduced to the events you are interested in.

The format of the entries in the configuration files is

    EvtSel.UMASK(.CMSK=...)(.AnyT)(.EDG)(.INV)(.TakenAlone)(.CTR=...)(.MSR_3F6H=...)(.MSR_PF=...)(.MSR_RSP0=...)(.MSR_RSP1=...) Name

You can find details on the meanings of the different parts of the entries in chapter 18 of [Intel's System Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-combined-volumes-3a-3b-3c-and-3d-system-programming-guide.html) and at <https://download.01.org/perfmon/readme.txt>.

## MSR Performance Counter Config Files

Some performance counters, such as the uncore counters or the RAPL counters on Intel CPUs, cannot be read with the `RDPMC` instruction, but only with the `RDMSR` instruction. The entries in the corresponding configuration files have the following format:

    msr_...=...(.msr_...=...)* msr_... Name

For example, the line

    msr_0xE01=0x20000000.msr_700=0x408F34 msr_706 LLC_LOOKUP_CBO_0

can be used to count the number of last-level cache lookups in C-Box 0 on a Skylake system. Details on this can be found in Intel's uncore performance monitoring reference manuals, e.g., [here](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/6th-gen-core-family-uncore-performance-monitoring-manual.pdf).

## Pausing Performance Counting

If the `-no_mem` option is used, nanoBench provides a feature to temporarily pause performance counting (however, this feature is not available for cycle-by-cycle measurements). This is enabled by including the *magic* byte sequences `0xF0B513B1C2813F04` (for stopping the counters), and `0xE0B513B1C2813F04` (for restarting them) in the code of the microbenchmark.

Using this feature incurs a certain timing overhead that will be included in the measurement results. It is therefore, in particular, useful for microbenchmarks that do not measure the time, but e.g., cache hits or misses, such as the microbenchmarks generated by the tools in [tools/CacheAnalyzer](tools/CacheAnalyzer).

## Debug Mode

If the debug mode is enabled, the [generated code](#generated-code) contains a breakpoint right before the line `m2 = read_perf_ctrs`, and *nanoBench* is run using *gdb*. This makes it possible to analyze the effect of the code to be benchmarked on registers and on the memory. The command `info all-registers` can, for example, be used to display the current values of all registers.

## Supported Platforms

*nanoBench* should work with all Intel processors supporting architectural performance monitoring version ≥ 2, as well as with AMD Family 17h processors. Cycle-by-cycle measurements are only available on Intel CPUs with at least four programmable performance counters.

The code was developed and tested using Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.
